# IRC PL code base

# Repository content
The run-docker.sh script uses the vinicf/core-9.0.3:latest image (https://hub.docker.com/r/vinicf/core-9.0.3)

The image has CORE 9.0.3 installed with all IRC TP dependencies.
It has been created using the Dockerfiles available in this repo (Dockerfile.amd64 and Dockerfile.arm64).

The script  runs a container and it also does the following:
- Creates a shared volume defined in SHARED variable ($SHARED:/shared).
- Shares the host display to run core-gui.
- Forwards the host's 2000 port to container's 22, enabling external ssh access.
- Injects the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub as an authorized host key (it does not create the keypair previously).


## How to run it
- Clone the repo in your home directory (it uses $HOME as a path reference for the shared directory): git clone https://github.com/vinicf/IRC.git
- If you do not have an id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub key pairs, create it using the command: ssh-keygen -t ed25519
- Make sure the run-docker.sh has execute permissions, recommended permissions: chmod 740 run-docker.sh
- Run the run-docker.sh script: ./run-docker.sh
- ENJOY

## What else
- You can access the container via ssh, using the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 key. E.g. if you are running it in your localhost: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@127.0.0.1 -p 2000
- The container's root password is core
- You can exchange files between container and host machine using the shared volume. Anything in your host $SHARED dir is accessible via container's /shared dir, and vice-versa.
- You can use the Dockerfile to create your own image, adding more libs and software, just remember to change the image in run-docker.sh script.
